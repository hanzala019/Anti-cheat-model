Tasks:
1 --> object detection and classification in real time
2 --> behaviour classification
3 --> creating custom datasets + using existing datasets
4 --> training a model based on the datasets
5 --> backend for handling database and real time communication with the 
6 --> frontend for video capturing and streaming 
    --> 1st page: records page where previous records of exams are displayed
    --> 2nd page: monitor page where real-time monitoring occurs 
7 --> Testing the model


possible Frameworks and Libraries we could use: 
1 --> OpenCV: For video processing and bounding box visualization.
2 --> YOLOv8: For object detection and tracking.
3 --> MediaPipe: For body pose and gesture analysis.
4 --> TensorFlow/PyTorch: For training custom models.
5 --> Flask/FastAPI: For creating APIs.
6 --> Socket.IO/WebRTC: For real-time video and data streaming.
